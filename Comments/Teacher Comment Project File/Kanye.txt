This semester in Computer Science, through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.  A successful student will know Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.

Kanye excelled at writing codes and has consistently finished homework all semester. He has shown exemplary work on the problem sets and that is reflected in Kanye's grade .Kanye struggled slightly in the beginning of the semester but eventually gained a firm grasp on the concepts and has shown significant improvement in the class.Kanye communicates very well with me. I really enjoyed talking about the wonderful ideas he has, and I would encourage also communicating more with peers.Kanye has received an A- on final exam.Although he did a good job at most problem sets with an average of 93%, he struggled a little about the transition of putting coding language into real-life application during exams.Over the course of time, I believe that he will gradually find a way of mastering it.This semester, Kanye finished several projects. Remarkably, Teacher-comment Writing Project was one of the best projects we had in class. It was a fabulous subject for interdisciplinary learning, especially in regard to its connection to everyday life. The student was excited to new understanding of design concepts and the application mathematics knowledge to complete their projects in preparation for sharing them with others. I am glad that he is keep improving, and I would like to see more interesting ideas and programs in the future. :)
