This semester in Computer Science, through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.  A successful student will know Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.

Jane excelled at collaborating with peers all semester. She has shown exemplary work on the problem sets and that is reflected in Jane's grade. Jane has shown a general mastery of all concepts throughout the year and has consistently shown exemplary work. Jane has not needed to come to see me outside of class for extra help, as she graps the content easily. Jane has received an A on final exam.Although she did a good job at most problem sets with an average of 99%, she struggled a little about the transition of putting coding language into real-life application during exams.Over the course of time, I believe that she will gradually find a way of mastering it. This semester, Jane finished several projects. Remarkably, the Craps Project was one of the best projects we had in class. The real-life aspect encouraged student investment in the activity and improved the quality of their work. I am glad that she is improving, and I would like to see more interesting ideas and programs in the future. :)
