This semester in Computer Science, through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language. A successful student will know Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.We are pleased with your progress this semester. Your problem set average was 97%, which indicated good time management, collaboration, and troubleshooting skills. You complete the problem sets that just about all of the other students in the class find challenging mostly independently without needing to ask others for help. We would encourage you to chat with your tablemates about how each of you completed an exercise, even if you all managed to do it successfully on your own, because it is important to learn different techniques, and you sit at a table with many clever friends to learn things from.On your bank customer service simulation partner project, you received an 85%. On the project, your work was very unique in that it included important aspects that hadn't occurred to other students to include; these helpful additions included things like charts to visualize wait times. That being said, your code needed more commenting in order to make it easier to understand and logical errors in your code unfortunately meant that the final output was incorrect. A good learning experience though! We are very excited to see what you achieve on next semester's big Pokemon project because your thinking is very unique.
