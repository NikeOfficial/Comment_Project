This semester in Computer Science, through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.  A successful student will know Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.

John excelled at working-hard and has performed well on tests all semester. He has shown poor work on the problem sets which is shown in John's final grade.John is struggling in the class and has not shown any improvement.I would encourage John to talk with me more, considering that our problem sets are sometimes more challenging. Computer science is a challenging course, in general, and it is very important to communicate and collaborate with different people!John has received an C+ on final exam.He needs to come to see me more outside of class for extra help and he should not be afraid of asking questions.Although he struggled a little about the transition of putting coding language into real-life application, I believe that he will gradually find a way of mastering it.This semester, John finished several projects. Remarkably, None was one of the best projects we had in class. This was a great project that integrated content across the curriculum while providing opportunities for differentiation and for all students to use their own personal strengths and styles to solve a problem. I am glad that he is keep improving, and I would like to see more interesting ideas and programs in the future. :)
