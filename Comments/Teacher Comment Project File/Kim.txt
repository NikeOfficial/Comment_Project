This semester in Computer Science, through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.  A successful student will know Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.

Kim excelled at completing homework all semester. She has shown exemplary work on the problem sets.Kim struggled significantly in the beginning of the semester but eventually began showing a slight understanding. I would reccomend that she review some of the beginning topics Kim sometimes seek help from me, which I would encourage she to talk with me more when having problems.Still,she maintains a good level of understanding, reflected by an average of 0.93 of problem sets.Kim has received an C- on final exam.Although she did a good job at most problem sets with an average of 93%, she struggled a little about the transition of putting coding language into real-life application during exams.Over the course of time, I believe that she will gradually find a way of mastering it.This semester, Kim finished several projects. Remarkably, Scrabbles Project was one of the best projects we had in class. It was a fabulous subject for interdisciplinary learning, especially in regard to its connection to everyday life. The student was excited to new understanding of design concepts and the application mathematics knowledge to complete their projects in preparation for sharing them with others. I am glad that she is keep improving, and I would like to see more interesting ideas and programs in the future. :)
