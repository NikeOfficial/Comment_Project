This semester in Computer Science, through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.  A successful student will know Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.

Miley excelled at completing high-quality projects all semester. Miley needs to show a greater understanding of all concepts in all assignmentsMiley has shown a general mastery of all concepts throughout the year and has consistently shown exemplary work.Miley communicates very well with me. I really enjoyed talking about the wonderful ideas she has, and I would encourage also communicating more with peers.Miley has received an A- on final exam.Althoughshe struggled a little about the transition of putting coding language into real-life application during exams,I believe that she will gradually find a way of mastering it.I encourage talking with me and peers because it will help you a lot.This semester, Miley finished several projects. Remarkably, Bank Project was one of the best projects we had in class. It provided students with various problem solving techniques and tools that could be used by all and gave them ideas and possible choices for future learning. I am glad that she is keep improving, and I would like to see more interesting ideas and programs in the future. :)
